# Banking-Management-System-DB
The Banking Management System is a SQL Server-based application designed to manage core banking operations including banks, branches, customers, accounts, employees, loans, and payments. It uses a relational database structure with primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity and model real-world banking relationships.

Key features include:

Customer and Account Management: Store and retrieve customer details, account balances, and loan information.

Automated Operations: SQL functions, procedures, cursors, and triggers automate eligibility checks and update account statuses based on balance thresholds.

Data Retrieval: Complex queries and joins enable efficient extraction of information across multiple tables, such as customer accounts, loans, and payments.

Simulation with Sample Data: Realistic sample data demonstrates account creation, loan processing, and payment tracking.

This project demonstrates practical skills in database design, SQL programming, and automation, providing a scalable and reliable system that simulates real-world banking workflows efficiently.
